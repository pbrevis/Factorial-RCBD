## Analysis of experimental data: Factorial RCBD

Example of a 2x3 factorial organized in a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with no significant interaction.

Treatments are herbicide application rate [0, 4 and 8 lb/acre] and delay in cultivation after spray [3 or 10 days].

Response variable is square root of the number of quack-grass shoots per square foot after spraying with herbicide (maleic hydrazide).

Analysis of variance and mean comparison were performed with the R package [agricolae](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/agricolae/index.html)
