# Analysis of experimental data with R package 'Agricolae'

Example of a 2x3 factorial organized in a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with no significant interactions.

Treatments are herbicide application rate [0, 4 and 8 lb/acre] and delay in cultivation after spray [3 or 10 days].

Response variable is square root of the number of quack-grass shoots per square foot after spraying with herbicide (maleic hydrazide).
